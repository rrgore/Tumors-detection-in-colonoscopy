# Automatic detection of tumors in colonoscopy using deep learning

## Project for CSE 591 - Topic: Image Analytics & Informatics at ASU

## Project Details

- Project 1 is the first iteration of 1st module of the project - Monitoring the quality of video frames in colonoscopy. We implemented transfer learning with Resnet-50 in this module. Please refer to **Paper_1(custom).ipynb** for the code that gave us the best outcome.
- Project 2 is the first iteration of 2nd module of the project - Detecting and locating tumors in the images extracted from the colonoscopy. We used Unet CNN model in this model. Please refer to **Atention_unet.ipynb** for the code that gave us the best outcome.
- Project 3 combines 1st and 2nd module of the project. An additional module - Classifying image whether it contains polyp or not - was added. Notable files are:
    - polyp_classification.ipynb
    - proj1_2.ipynb
